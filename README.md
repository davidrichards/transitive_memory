# Transitive Memory

It's nice to remember everything. There are certain things, given enough exposure, that follow the Dreyfus model well:

- Novice: wanting a solution, looking for context.
- Advanced Beginner: chosen a stack, looking for recipes.
- Competent: see the big picture, looking for rhythms.
- Proficient: self-correcting, looking for wins.
- Expert: available to lead, playing to win-win.

External support works always, but if I do the ground work, these become more powerful.
